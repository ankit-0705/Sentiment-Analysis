# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis tool that evaluates the sentiment of tweets using the TextBlob library in Python. The tool reads tweets from a JSON file and provides insights into the sentiment polarity and subjectivity of each tweet.

Features
Data Extraction: Load tweets from a JSON file.
Text Cleaning: Remove unwanted characters, URLs, and numbers to prepare the text for analysis.
Shortening Tweets: Display a shortened version of each tweet for better readability.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of each tweet and classify it as positive, neutral, or negative, along with the orientation (data-driven or opinion-based).
User Input: Allow users to set a limit on the number of tweets to analyze.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Place your JSON file containing the tweets in the specified file path in the script.
Run the Python script in your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
Input the desired limit of tweets to analyze when prompted.
The script will output each tweet along with its sentiment analysis results.
